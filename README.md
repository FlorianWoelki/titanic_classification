# Titanic Classification Problem

This simple classification project was meant to learn and train to handle and visualize data.

With the titanic classification problem you learn, how to normalize data, visualize it and how to apply a neural network or other machine learning model on the dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dataset

You can find the Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This dataset is pretty simple and do not need to normalize it so heavily.

In this repository I visualized the data and created a DNN for predicting, how much passengers will survive oder die based on the given data (e.g. gender, passenger class).
