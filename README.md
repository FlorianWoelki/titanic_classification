<h1 align="center">Titanic Classification</h1>

<p align="center">
This simple classification project was meant to learn and train to handle and visualize data.
</p>


## 🤔 What is this project about?
With the titanic classification problem you learn, how to normalize data, visualize it and how to apply a neural network or other machine learning model on the dataset.

You can find the Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This dataset is pretty simple and do not need to normalize it so heavily.

In this repository I visualized the data and created a DNN for predicting, how much passengers will survive oder die based on the given data (e.g. gender, passenger class).
